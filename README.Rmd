<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This package can be used to quickly set up a project skeleton suitable for data analysis. It sets up [drake](https://docs.ropensci.org/drake/) as well as a lab notebook that is built with [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/).

## Installation

You can install the released version of skeleton from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("ngriffiths21/skeleton")
```

## Usage

Start from an R project (create one in RStudio or with usethis::create_project, or use a new git repo).

``` r
skeleton::use_skeleton()
```
